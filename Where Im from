<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
<p>I am originally born in maryland, but my family is from Cameroon.

Cameroon is at the junction of western and central Africa. There are more than 1700 different linguistic groups in the country and over 230 other languages are spoken in the region apart from its official languages, French and English.</p>

<p>My dad family is from the english side and my mom family is from the french side of Cameroon. I never really bothered on trying to learn how to speak freanch, but now that I think about it, I shpuld have tried to learn how to speak it. Welp I can always still learn.
