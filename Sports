<h1>Sports</h1>
<p>I love to play sports a lot. I play basketball, football, soccer, and I ran track. I only played soccer and basketball for fun, but I ran track and played football for my highschool back in Maryland. I am in love with football. Actually, one of the resaons I can to mizzou wasn't only for school, but to play football as well. My plan is to walk on in the spring and make the team and my journey would start from there. I'm a competitive person especially when it comes to sports.</p>

<p>I felt like soccer was boring even though I can play it and I only play basketball for fun. What I mean by that is I wouldn't join an organization or something like that.</p>

<p>I also told you guys I ran track in high school. Let me tell you something, track speed is a is a whole different ball game. Track speed and football speed is very different. I'm pretty fast, but theres always going to be someone faster than you. I remeber my freshman year, I ran track and got a gold medal in the 400. My senoir we made it to regionals in the 4x200, but we ended up losing because we came 3rd. To go to states you have to be top 2 so yeah. It was pretty fun though not going to lie.</p>

<p>My favorite team is the Baltimore Raven. I don't care what anybody say we winning the super bowl this year. We just destroyed the chargers last week and the chiefs as well. We are unstoppable. Name a team better than us, I'll wait..... Oh ok I didnt think so.
