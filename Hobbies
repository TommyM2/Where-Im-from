<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>As I said before , I like playing sports, but I also like to watch anime and play video games on my free time.</p>

<p>I feel like anime is better cartoons plus some animes teach life lessons in it such as never giving up, know your friends and enemies, and so on. My favorite anime of all time is naruto and it is the best anime to ever be created. The first episode of naruto would just make you want to cry. You got to watch it. Isay second goes to bleach then third would be one piece.</p>

<p>Videogames is a whole different story. I started from a gameboy, to a ds, then a Wii, 3ds, Xbox 360, and now a PS4. So Ive been around electronics for a long time. I dont really have a favorite game but the game I'm most good at is Naruto Storm. Nobody is beating me in that. I've been playing it since naruto storm generation came out and now its on storm 4 so just imagine. Since 2013, I can't make this up.
