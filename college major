<h1>Dreams and Goals</h1>
<p>Ok so there's a lot talk about on this topic, my major. I'm not going to lie, at first I was confused on what I wanted to do. I really still don't know what I wanted to do. It was between two mjors, IT or Computer Science. I heard computer science was harder than It and that it takes a lot of time. The thing is if I make the team, i dont know how I'm going to juggle all of that at once plus my job as well.</p>

<p>So I was just like I'm just going to major in IT, besides that what I wanted to do anyway. Now I'm starting to think if I shouldv'e just stayed with Computer Science. I planning on talking to my counselor so that I can see where my head is at right now and what path should I take to better my career and myself. From what I know already, the only difference is the salery and that Computer Science basically makes the programs while IT fixes it. It really just depends on the job.</p>

<p><b>The reason I chose IT/Computer Science field was bevause I been around electronics throughout my life. So I wanted to do something in the electric field. Probably one day I'll make my on game or something who knows. i really want to learn how to code because I dont really know that much off the top of my head.
